"Put it on record.  I am an Arab And the number of my card is fifty thousand I have eight children And the ninth is due after summer. What's there to be angry about? Put it on record.  I am an Arab˜ Working with comrades of toil in a quarry. I have eight children For them I wrest the loaf of bread, The clothes and exercise books From the rocks And beg for no alms at your door,  Lower not myself at your doorstep.  What's there to be angry about? Put it on record.  I am an Arab. I am a name without a title, Patient in a country where everything Lives in a whirlpool of anger.  My roots  Took hold before the birth of time  Before the burgeoning of the ages,  Before cypress and olive trees,  Before the proliferation of weeds. My father is from the family of the plough  Not from highborn nobles. And my grandfather was a peasant  Without line or genealogy. My house is a watchman's hut  Made of sticks and reeds. Does my status satisfy you?  I am a name without a surname. Put it on record.  I am an Arab. Colour of hair: jet black. Colour of eyes: brown. My distinguishing features:  On my head the `iqal cords over a keffiyeh  Scratching him who touches it. My address:  I'm from a village, remote, forgotten,  Its streets without name  And all its men in the fields and quarry.  What's there to be angry about? Put it on record.  I am an Arab. You stole my forefathers' vineyards  And land I used to till,  I and all my children,  And you left us and all my grandchildren  Nothing but these rocks.  Will your government be taking them too  As is being said? So!  Put it on record at the top of page one:  I don't hate people,  I trespass on no one's property. And yet, if I were to become hungry  I shall eat the flesh of my usurper.  Beware, beware of my hunger  And of my anger!",Title 1,Mahmoud Darwish
"Your eyes are a thorn in my heart Inflicting pain, yet I cherish that thorn And shield it from the wind. I sheathe it in my flesh, I sheathe it, protecting it from night and agony, And its wound lights the lanterns, Its tomorrow makes my present Dearer to me than my soul. And soon I forget, as eye meets eye, That once, behind the doors, there were two of us. Your words were a song And I tried to sing, too, But agony encircled the lips of spring. And like the swallow, your words took wing, The door of our home and the autumnal threshold migrated, To follow you wherever led by longing Our mirrors were shattered, And sorrow was multiplied a thousand fold. And we gathered the splinters of sound, Mastering only the elegy of our homeland! Together were will plant it in the heart of a lyre, And on the rooftops of our tragedy we’ll play it To mutilated moons and to stones. But I have forgotten, you of the unknown voice: Was it your departure that rushed the lyre or was it my silence? Yesterday I saw you in the port, A long voyager without provisions, Like an orphan I ran to you, Asking the wisdom of our forefathers: How can the ever-verdant orange grove be dragged To prison, to exile, to a port, And despite all her travels, Despite the scent of salt and longing, Remain evergreen? I write in my diary: I love oranges and hate the port And I write further: On the dock I stood, and saw the world through Witter’s eyes Only the orange peel is ours, and behind me lay the desert. In the briar-covered mountains I saw you, A shepherdess without sheep, Pursued among the ruins. You were my garden, and I a stranger, Knocking at the door, my heart, For upon my heart stand firm The door and windows, the cement and stones. I have seen you in casks of water, in granaries, Broken, I have seen you a maid in night clubs, I have seen you in the gleam of tears and in wounds. You are the other lung in my chest; You are the sound on my lips; You are water; you are fire. I saw you at the mouth of the cave, at the cavern, Hanging your orphans’ rags on the wash line. In the stoves, in the streets I have seen you. In the barns and in the sun’s blood. In the songs of the orphaned and the wretched I have seen you. I have seen you in the salt of the sea and in the sand. Yours was the beauty of the earth, of children and of Arabian jasmine. And I have vowed To fashion from my eyelashes a kerchief, And upon it to embroider verses for your eyes, And a name, when watered by a heart that dissolves in chanting, Will make the sylvan arbours grow. I shall write a phrase more precious than honey and kisses: ‘Palestinian she was and still is’. On a night of storms, I opened the door and the window To see the hardened moon of our nights. I said to the night: Run out, Beyond the darkness and the wall; I have a promise to keep with words and light. You are my virgin garden As long as our songs Are swords when we draw them. And you are as faithful as grain So long as our songs Keep alive the fertile soil when we plant them. You are like a palm tree in the mind: Neither storm nor woodsman’s ax can fell it. Its braids uncut By the beasts of desert and forest But I am the exiled one behind wall and door, Shelter me in the warmth of your gaze. Take me, wherever you are, Take me, however you are. To be restored to the warmth of face and body, To the light of heart and eye, To the salt of bread and song, To the taste of earth and homeland. Shelter me in the warmth of your gaze, Take me, a panel of almond wood, in the cottage of sorrows, Take me, a verse from the book of my tragedy, Take me, a plaything or a stone from the house, So that our next generation may recall The path of return to our home. Her eyes and the tattoo on her hands are Palestinian, Her name, Palestinian, Her dreams, and sorrow, Palestinian, Her Kerchief, her feet and body, Palestinian, Her words and her silence, Palestinian, Her voice, Palestinian, Her birth and her death, Palestinian, I have carried you in my old notebooks As the fire of my verses, The sustenance for my journeys. In your name, my voice rang in the valleys: I have seen Byzantium’s horses Even though the battle be different. Beware, oh beware The lightning struck by my song in the granite. I am the flower of youth and the knight of knights! I am the smasher of idols. I plant the Levantine borders With poems that set eagles free. And in your name I have shouted at the enemy: Worms, feed on my flesh if ever I slumber, For the eggs of ants cannot hatch eagles, And the shell of the adder’s egg Holds but a snake! I have seen Byzantium’s horses, And before it all, I know That I am the flower of youth and the knight of knights! PIZZA Greetings and a kiss, and I have nothing else to say after this Where do I begin?..And where do I end? And time just cycles infinitely  All I have in my exile is a lunchbox, in it is a dry piece of bread, and yearning And a journal that shoulders some of my burden I spat in its pages whatever bitterness tightened my chest  Where do I begin? And all that is said, and will be said, does not end with a hug...  or a touch  It will not return the exiled home Nor will it make rain fall Nor will it grow feathers on the broken wing of a lost, fatigued bird Where do I begin? Greetings....a kiss....and furthermore... 2 I say to the radio..tell her I am fine I say to the bird If you bump into her, oh bird, then don’t forget me and say: fine I am fine I am fine Sight is still in my eyes! The moon is still in the sky! And my dress, till now, has not been fully wrecked Its sides tore But I patched it up..and it’s still fine And I became a young man in his twenties Imagine that..I am in my twenties! And I became like other young men, ma! confronting life and carrying stresses like men do And I work! In a restaurant....I wash dishes And make coffee for the customer And paste smiles upon my sad face so the customer is happy 3 I am fine I am in my twenties And I am like other young men, ma! I smoke tobacco, and lean on a wall I say to the pretty girls “hey“ like others say “Brothers, how sweet are girls! Imagine how bitter life would be without them..so bitter Is life” And my friend said “Do you have a loaf of bread? Brothers, what is the value of human life if one goes to bed every night....hungry?” I am fine I am fine I have a loaf of wheat bread And a small basket of veggies 4 I heard on the radio greetings of the homeless...to the homeless Everyone said: We are all fine! No one is sad; So, how is my dad? Is he still the way he’s always been, likes to remember God, children, soil and olives? And how are my brothers Are they all employed? I heard my dad once say they will all become teachers... I heard him say “I’ll buy them books even if I go hungry” No one in my village can make out a single letter in an a speech  And how is our sister? Has she grown....does she have any suitors? And how is my grandmother? Is she still like she’s always been, sitting by the door praying for goodness, for youthfulness, and reward for us? And how is our house? the smooth front step, the fire pit, and the doors? I heard on the radio, messages of the homeless...to the homeless They are all fine! But I am sad almost consumed by suspicions, The radio did not relay a single piece of news about you Even if a sad one Even if a sad one 5 Night, oh ma, is a ravenous, murderous, wolf It chases the exiled wherever he goes It opens the horizon to the ghosts and the forest of willow trees still hugs the winds What have we reaped, oh ma? For us to die twice once in life and once while we’re alive Do you know what fills me with tears? Imagine I got sick one day...and sickness wore me down! Will the night remember? An exiled that came...and did not return home? Will the night remember An exile who died without a shroud? Oh forest of willow trees! will you remember that the one they threw under your sad shadow like any other dead thing, is human? Will you remember that I am human? And protect my body from the assault of vultures? Ma, oh ma! To whom have I written these pages? Which outgoing mail will carry it? When the path on land, sea and the horizon has been closed shut And you, oh ma! and my dad, my siblings, my family and my friends Perhaps you are alive Perhaps you are dead Perhaps you are like me, without an address What is the value of a human Without a home Without a flagship Without an address What is the value of a human? PIZZA I was there a month ago. I was there a year ago. I was always there as if I was never anywhere else. In 1982 the same thing happened to us as is happening now. We were besieged and killed and fought against the hell we encountered. The casualties/martyrs don’t resemble one another. Each of them has a distinctive physique and distinctive features, different eyes and a different name and age. The killers are the ones who all look the same. They are one being, distributed over different pieces of hardware, pressing electronic buttons, killing and vanishing. He sees us but we don’t see him, not because he’s a ghost but because he’s a steel mask on an idea – he is featureless, eyeless, ageless and nameless. It is he who has chosen to have a single name: the enemy.",Title 2, Darwish
